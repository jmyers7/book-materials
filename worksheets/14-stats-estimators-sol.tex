\bigskip

\prob Suppose $X\sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, 1)$ and that we define two estimators by

	\[\widehat{\mu}_1 = X \quad \text{and} \quad \widehat{\mu}_2 = 3.
	\]

Compute the mean squared errors of $\widehat{\mu}_1$ and $\widehat{\mu}_2$.

\bigskip
\textcolor{red}{Since $\widehat{\mu}_2=3$ is constant, we have
	\[R(\mu,\widehat{\mu}_2) = E((\mu -3)^2) = (\mu-3)^2.
	\]
By linearity of expectation, we have
	\[R(\mu,\widehat{\mu}_1) = E( (\mu - \widehat{\mu}_1)^2 ) = \mu^2 -2\mu E(\widehat{\mu}_1) + E(\widehat{\mu}_1^2) .
	\]
But we have $E(\widehat{\mu}_1) = \mu$, and from the short-cut formula for variance, we have
	\[E(\widehat{\mu}_1^2) = 1 + E(\widehat{\mu}_1)^2 = 1 + \mu^2.
	\]
Thus,
	\[R(\mu,\widehat{\mu}_1) = \mu^2 -2\mu^2 +1 + \mu^2 = 1.
	\]}

\bigskip
\prob Suppose that the number $X$ of defects on a roll of magnetic recording tape has a Poisson distribution for which the mean $\mu$ is either $1.0$ or $1.5$. Supposing that the prior probability function on $\mu$ is given by

	\[p(\mu) = \begin{cases}
	0.4 & : \mu = 1.0, \\
	0.6 & : \mu = 1.5, \\
	0 & : \text{otherwise},
	\end{cases}
	\]

and that a selected roll of tape has $X=3$ defects, what is the posterior probability function of $\mu$? What is $\widehat{\mu}_{\text{MAP}}$?

\bigskip
\textcolor{red}{From Bayes' Theorem and the Law of Total Probability, we have
	\begin{align*}
	p(\mu | x=3) &= \frac{p(x=3 | \mu)p(\mu)}{p(x=3|\mu = 1.0)p(\mu=1.0) + p(x=3|\mu = 1.5)p(\mu=1.5)} \\
	&= \frac{ \frac{1}{3!} \mu^3 e^{-\mu} p(\mu)}{\frac{1}{3!} e^{-1}\cdot 0.4 + \frac{1}{3!} (1.5)^3 e^{-1.5}\cdot 0.6} \\
	& \approx \begin{cases}
	0.246 & : \mu =1.0, \\
	0.754 & : \mu = 1.5, \\
	0 & : \text{otherwise}.
	\end{cases}
	\end{align*}
From this, we see that $\widehat{\mu}_{\text{MAP}} = 1.5$.}
