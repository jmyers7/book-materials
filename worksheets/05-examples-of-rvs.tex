\prob Determine whether each of the following random variables is a binomial distribution. If so, identify the values of the shape parameters $n$ and $\theta$.

\medskip
\begin{enumerate}
\item $X=$ the number of $4$'s in ten rolls of a fair die.\vfill
\item $X=$ the number of multiple-choice questions a student gets right on a $40$-question test, when each question has four choices and the student is completely guessing.\vfill
\item Same as part (b), but now half the questions have two possible answers and the other half four.\vfill
\end{enumerate}

\prob When circuit boards used in the manufacture of DVD players are tested, the long-run percentage of defectives is 5\%. Let $X =$ the number of defective boards in a random sample of size $n = 25$, so $X \sim \mathcal{B}in(25, 0.05)$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Determine $P(X\leq 2)$.\vfill
\item Determine $P(X\geq 5)$.\vfill

\prob Suppose that 30\% of the applicants for a certain industrial job possess advanced training in computer programming. Applicants are interviewed sequentially and are selected at random from the pool.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Find the probability that the first applicant with advanced training in programming is found on the fifth interview.\vfill
\item Find the probability that the first applicant with advanced training in programming is found in one of the first five interviews.\vfill
\item What is the expected number of applicants who need to be interviewed in order to find the first one with advanced training?\vfill

\prob Given that we have already tossed a fair coin ten times and obtained zero heads, what is the probability that we must toss it at least two more times to obtain the first head?\vfill











\newpage
\prob Five individuals from an animal population thought to be near extinction in a region have been caught, tagged, and released to mix into the population. After they have had an opportunity to mix, a random sample of ten of these animals is selected. Let $X =$ the number of tagged animals in the second sample. If there are actually 25 animals of this type in the region, what is the probability that

\item $X = 2$?\vfill
\item $X\leq2$?\vfill

\prob A geologist has collection 10 specimens of basaltic rock and 10 specimens of granite. The geologist instructs a laboratory assistant to randomly select 15 of the specimens for analysis.

\medskip
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the PMF of the number of granite specimens selected for analysis?\vfill
\item What is the probability that all specimens of one of the two types of rock are selected for analysis?\vfill
\item What is the probability that the number of granite specimens selected for analysis is within one standard deviation of its mean value?\vfill

\begin{enumerate}
\item Describe a distribution that models the number $X$ of customers that arrive at the store during a two-hour time interval.\vfill
\item Compute the probabilities that one customer arrives in the time interval, and that ten customers arrive.\vfill
\item Compute the probabilities that at most five customers arrive in the time interval, and that more than ten arrive.\vfill

\prob There are two machines available for cutting corks intended for use in wine bottles. The first produces corks with diameters that are normally distributed with mean $3$ cm and standard deviation $0.1$ cm. The second machine produces corks with diameters that have a normal distribution with mean $3.04$ cm and standard deviation $0.02$ cm. Acceptable corks have diameters between $2.9$ and $3.1$ cm. Which machine is more likely to produce an acceptable cork?\vfill

\prob Historical evidence indicates that times $X$ between fatal accidents on scheduled American domestic passenger flights have an approximately exponential distribution. Assume that the mean time between accidents is 44 days.

\medskip
\begin{enumerate}
\item If one of the accidents occurred on July 1 of a randomly selected year in the study period, what is the probability that another accident occurred that same month?\vfill
\item What is the variance of the times between accidents?\vfill

\prob Suppose that when a type of transistor is subjected to an accelerated life test, the lifetime $T$ (in weeks) has a gamma distribution with mean $24$ weeks and standard deviation $12$ weeks.

\medskip
\begin{enumerate}
\item What is the probability that a transistor will last between 12 and 24 weeks?\vfill
\item What is the probability that a transistor will last at most 24 weeks? Is the median of the lifetime distribution less than 24? Why or why not?\vfill

\prob A gasoline wholesale distributor has bulk storage tanks that hold fixed supplies and are filled every Monday. Of interest to the wholesaler is the proportion $X$ of this supply that is sold during the week. Over many weeks of observation, the distributor found that this proportion could be modeled by a beta distribution with $\alpha = 4$ and $\beta = 2$. Find the probability that the wholesaler will sell at least $90\%$ of her stock in a given week.
