Part of what makes that library so powerful and useful is that it hides the training process from the user, allowing the user to focus on extracting insights and enlightenment from their data without worrying about technical stuff. But, at least once in their career, analysts should see what it takes to train a probabilistic model _from scratch_. That's what we're going to do in this assignment.\n",

Our workflow is this:\n",

To get the multiplications to work correctly, you may need to reshape your tensors from shapes `(6,)` and `(512,`) to shapes `(1, 6)` and `(512, 1)` by using the `reshape` method from PyTorch. Here's how it works: If `T` is a tensor of shape `(n,)` and you want to turn it into a column vector of shape `(n, 1`), write `T.reshape(-1, 1)`. If you want to turn it into a row vector of shape `(1, n)`, write `T.reshape(1, -1)`."
