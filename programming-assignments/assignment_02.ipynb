    "In the heart of Aquilonia, a picturesque town nestled amidst rolling hills and lush greenery, a mysterious ailment plagues the citizens: *hydromechanical trepidation syndrome*, or *HTS*. This peculiar affliction instills in the townsfolk a perpetual fear, not of life's typical perils, but of the water fountains that adorn the town square.\n",
    "\n",
    "For generations, Aquilonians have lived harmoniously with the babbling brooks and glistening lakes that graced their idyllic landscape. Water had been their lifeblood, revered as a symbol of purity and serenity. But something had shifted; a shadow of dread had cast itself over their tranquil existence. Fear now gripped the townsfolk, causing them to cross the street to avoid passing too near a fountain. Even the town's cherished elder, Old Man Willoughby, found himself trembling at their sight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amidst this despair, the town council turned to *you*, a statistician well-versed in epidemiology and the analysis of unusual outbreaks. *Your mission:* to assess the effectiveness of a newly developed test for detecting HTS in Aquilonia. Your role involves scrutinizing the test's accuracy and reliability in identifying those afflicted with this enigmatic ailment.\n"
