**Suggested problems for Section [6.7](https://mml.johnmyersmath.com/stats-book/chapters/06-random-vectors.html#the-law-of-total-probability-and-bayes-theorem-for-random-variables).** ([Solutions](./21-suggested-problems-sol.md))

**Problem 1**: Suppose that $X\mid N \sim \mathcal{B}in(n,\theta)$, where $n$ is an observed value of $N \sim \mathcal{B}in(m,\phi)$. Show that the marginal distribution of $X$ is $\mathcal{B}in(m,\theta\phi)$. _Hint_: The identity

$$
\binom{m}{n} \binom{n}{x} = \binom{m}{x}\binom{m-x}{n-x}
$$

will likely be helpful.

**Problem 2**: Let $X$ be the number of flips of a coin until the first head is obtained. So, for example, $X=1$ means that a head was obtained on the first flip, while $X=2$ means that the first head was obtained on the second flip. Suppose that the coin has probability $\theta$ of landing heads, and that $\theta$ is an observed value of a continuous random variable distributed uniformly on the closed interval $[0,1]$.

**(a)** Compute the conditional mass function $p(x|\theta)$.

**(b)** Compute the posterior density $f(\theta | x)$.
