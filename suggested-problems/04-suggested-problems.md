**Problem 5**: A box contains five keys, only one of which will open a lock. Keys are randomly selected and tried, one at a time, until the lock is opened (keys that do not work are discarded before another is tried). Let $s\in \mathbb{R}$ be the number of the trial on which the lock is opened.

**(a)** Assuming the probability measure $P$ on $S$ is uniform, find the mass function of $P$. (*Hint*: It has support $\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$.)

**(b)** Give the corresponding distribution function.

**Problem 6**: Suppose that a probability measure $P$ on $S = \mathbb{R}$ has a CDF $F(s)$ whose graph is shown [here](../img/cdf.png). (Replace the $x$ with an $s$.) Compute the following probabilities:

**(a)** $P(\\{-1\\})$

**(b)** $P\big( (-\infty,0) \big)$

**(c)** $P \big( (-\infty,0] \big)$

**(a)** Is the measure $P$ discrete or continuous? Explain.

**(b)** Compute a formula for either a mass function or density function of $P$, depending on whether you determine $P$ is discrete or continuous.

**(c)** Compute the median of the probability distribution $P$.
