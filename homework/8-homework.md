# Homework for [Chapter 8](https://mml.johnmyersmath.com/stats-book/chapters/08-more-prob.html#)

List of problems:

1. [Independence and expectations](#problem-1)
2. [Expectation of a transformation of uniform variables](#problem-2)

## Problem 1: Independence and expectations

Suppose that $X$ and $Y$ are two independent, continuous random variables. Prove that $E(XY) = E(X)E(Y)$. (This is [Theorem 8.2](https://mml.johnmyersmath.com/stats-book/chapters/08-more-prob.html#ind-expect-thm) in the book.)

## Problem 2: Expectation of a transformation of uniform variables

Suppose that three random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ form a random sample from the continuous uniform distribution on $[0,1]$. Determine the value of the expectation

$$
E\left[ (X - 2Y + Z)^2\right].
$$
