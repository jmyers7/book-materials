**List of problems:**

1. [Independence and expectations](#problem-1-independence-and-expectations)
2. [Expectation of a transformation of an IID random sample](#problem-2-expectation-of-a-transformation-of-an-iid-random-sample)

**Guidelines:** You are free to work and collaborate with your classmates, but you must turn in your own written solutions. Do not consult any outside resources for your solutions, including anything on the web. Late submissions will not be accepted. You must show all relevant steps in any computations, and in problems that ask for explanations or proofs, you must write in complete sentences with correct grammar and correct notation. Sloppy and confusing solutions are inappropriate for students in a class at this level, and will be penalized accordingly.

## Problem 1: Independence and expectations

(_From [Section 8.1](https://mml.johnmyersmath.com/stats-book/chapters/08-more-prob.html#expectations-and-joint-distributions)_.) Suppose that $X$ and $Y$ are two independent, continuous random variables. Prove that $E(XY) = E(X)E(Y)$. (This is [Theorem 8.2](https://mml.johnmyersmath.com/stats-book/chapters/08-more-prob.html#ind-expect-thm) in the book.)

## Problem 2: Expectation of a transformation of an IID random sample

(_From [Section 8.1](https://mml.johnmyersmath.com/stats-book/chapters/08-more-prob.html#expectations-and-joint-distributions)_.) Let three random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ form an IID random sample from the continuous uniform distribution on $[0,1]$. Determine the value of the expectation

$$
E\left[ (X - 2Y + Z)^2\right].
$$

## Problem 3: Expectation of a transformation of two variables

(_From [Section 8.1](https://mml.johnmyersmath.com/stats-book/chapters/08-more-prob.html#expectations-and-joint-distributions)_.) Suppose that $X$ and $Y$ are jointly continuous with density

$$
f(x,y) = \begin{cases}
2x & : 0 \leq x \leq 1, \ 0 \leq y \leq 1, \\
0 & : \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
$$

Compute $E(XY)$.
