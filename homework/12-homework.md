# Homework for [Chapter 12: Probabilistic graphical models](https://mml.johnmyersmath.com/stats-book/chapters/12-models.html)

**Due date**: TBD

**Guidelines:** You are free to work and collaborate with your classmates, but you must turn in your own written solutions. Do not consult any outside resources for your solutions, including anything on the web. Late submissions will not be accepted.

**List of problems:**

1. 

 **Tips (to maximize your grade)**:
 
1. Show all relevant steps in all computations. However, I do not need to see trivial things like, for example, the intermediate steps in computing an integral. But if there is a key step in a set of computations that you skip over, I'll have to remove a point or two. Use your best judgment.

2. Explain your work and reasoning using complete and grammatically correct sentences. (It is a myth that mathematicians, engineers, and scientists are all bad at writing. We do many goodly words!)
 
3. Use correct notation.

4. Your goal is to demonstrate your depth of understanding, not simply that you obtained the correct answer. Your goal is to _explain_, as if you're trying to teach me the material.

5. Figure out the answer before writing! More precisely: Carry through your initial computations on your own scratch paper before writing your solutions.  It is difficult to follow a solution that is written in a "stream-of-consciousness" style. If I can't follow along, I am likely to give up and take off points (even if your final answer is right).

## Problem x:

(_From [Section 12.1](https://mml.johnmyersmath.com/stats-book/chapters/12-models.html#a-brief-look-at-causal-inference)_.)

**(a)**: Give a concrete example of three random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ (other than the examples discussed in class) where $Y$ serves as a confounding variable in the causal structure.

**(b)**: Give a concrete example of three random variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ (other than the examples discussed in class) where $Y$ serves as a mediating variable in the causal structure.

## Problem x: 

(_From [Section 12.1](https://mml.johnmyersmath.com/stats-book/chapters/12-models.html#a-brief-look-at-causal-inference)_.) Suppose that we have four binary random variables

$$
C, R, W, S,
$$

which indicate whether it is cloudy ($C$), whether it is raining ($R$), whether the grass is wet ($W$), and whether the sprinkler is running ($S$). Draw a plausible graph depicting the cause and effect relationships between these variables.
