\prob Let the sample space $S$ represent the current population of the United States. Suppose also that to every individual $s\in S$ we assign the state $X(s)$ in which they currently reside. So, for example, I would write
	\[
	X(\text{John}) = \text{New York}.
	\]
Does this function
	\[
	X: S \to \{\text{Alabama}, \text{Alaska},\ldots,\text{Wyoming}\}
	\]
qualify as a random variable on $S$? If not, how could you make it fit the template of a random variable?\vfill
